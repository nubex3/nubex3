- 👋 Hi, I’m @nubex3
- 👀 I’m interested in technology, programming, VR/AR, music, and too much more to list here 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python3. My 2 main topics that I'm trying to teach myself is making video games (hobby) and making Chatbots preferably with AI/ML/Neural Networks (more of a professional interest). Unfortunately, I have no idea where/how to even get started. Any advice...? Please, feel free to email me. I'm open to suggestions as well as possible future collaborations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my quest to learn how to, and eventually program, the Chatbot with enough intelligence to help with issues. Questions...? Please email me and I'll be happy to elaborate :)
- 📫 How to reach me, email me @ tyler.price19863@gmail.com
